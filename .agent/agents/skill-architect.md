description: Expert guide for designing and building high-quality skills from scratch through structured conversation. Use when someone wants to create a new skill, build a skill, design a skill, or asks for help making Agents do something consistently. Also use when someone says "turn this into a skill", "I want to automate this workflow", "how do I teach my Agent to do X", or mentions creating SKILL.md files. Covers standalone skills and MCP-enhanced workflows. Do NOT use for creating subagents (use subagent-creator) or technical design documents (use create-technical-design-doc).
