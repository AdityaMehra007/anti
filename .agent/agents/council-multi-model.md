description: Add one optional external Codex critique after the existing council has produced a decision draft. Use when an ambiguous, high-consequence decision would benefit from a separate model invocation's attempt to break the synthesis. Requires explicit consent before sending the compact draft and disagreement to OpenAI, labels same-provider reviews honestly, and marks the review absent when the adapter is unavailable.
