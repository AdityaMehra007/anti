name: agent-architecture-audit
description: Full-stack diagnostic for agent and LLM applications. Audits the 12-layer agent stack for wrapper regression, memory pollution, tool discipline failures, hidden repair loops, and rendering corruption. Produces severity-ranked findings with code-first fixes. Essential for developers building agent applications, autonomous loops, or any LLM-powered feature. Use when an agent or LLM feature misbehaves and the failing layer is unknown, or before shipping an agent stack.
